                    In the distant future, Evey Hammond is an average citizen of
                    the United Kingdom, which is under the rule of the fascist
                    and tyrannical Norsefire Party. She is an employee of the
                    state-run British Television Network, but soon, she becomes
                    the number one enemy of the state together with an enigmatic
                    and larger-than-life freedom fighter known only by the
                    letter "V". V informs Evey that she must hide in his
                    underground lair for at least one year, and while she is
                    reluctant to the idea at first, a bond soon forms between
                    the two individuals. In the meanwhile, the mysterious past
                    of V is gradually revealed to the police inspector tasked
                    with capturing him, Eric Finch, and it is not long until he
                    starts questioning everything his government stands for.
